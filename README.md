# What-I-Learned-Week11

### Overview
   
    We covered quite a bit in this week, a lot, honestly a little too much if you ask me, but 2 of the concepts I wanted to hone in on, to include:

## Keyword ['this'](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_object_methods.asp) *


## [__Dirname](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-__dirname-and-in-node-js/) *

* I've included links for some pages for some added clarity to reference.

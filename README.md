# What-I-Learned-Week11

### Overview
   
We covered quite a bit in this week, a lot,
 honestly a little *too* much if you ask me, but 2 of the concepts I wanted to hone in on, to include:

## Keyword ['this'](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_object_methods.asp) *
What is this?

The JavaScript this keyword refers to the object it belongs to.

It has different values depending on where it is used:

- **In a method**, this refers to the owner object.

- **Alone**, this refers to the global object.
  
- **In a function**, this refers to the global object.

    In a function, in strict mode, this is undefined.
    In an event, this refers to the element that received the event.
